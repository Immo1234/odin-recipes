    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>9 lasagna noodles <br>
        ¼ cup margarine <br>
        ¼ cup all-purpose flour<br>
        ½ teaspoon salt<br>
        ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper<br>
        1 cup milk<br>
        ½ cup vegetable broth, or as needed<br>
        2 tablespoons white wine<br>
        ½ cup grated Parmesan cheese<br>
        1 cup light ricotta cheese<br>
        1 egg<br>
        1 egg white<br>
        1 tablespoon olive oil<br>
        2 cups coarsely shredded carrots<br>
        2 cups coarsely chopped zucchini<br>
        1 (10 ounce) package frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained<br>
        1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</p>
   
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Step 1 
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
        Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until 
        cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.

        <p> Step 2
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
    </p>
        <p>Step 3
        Melt margarine in a skillet over low heat; cook and stir flour, salt, 
        and pepper into the melted margarine until smooth and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. 
        Add milk and broth into flour mixture, stirring constantly; bring sauce to a boil. 
        Stir wine into sauce and remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into sauce until
         smooth.
    </p>
        <p>Step 4
        Whisk ricotta cheese, egg, and egg white together in a bowl.
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 5
        Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute carrots, zucchini, 
        and spinach until just becoming tender, 5 to 10 minutes. 
        Stir vegetable mixture into ricotta mixture.
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 6
        Layer 1/3 the lasagna noodles, 1/3 the ricotta-vegetable mixture, 
        and 1/3 the Parmesan sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish; 
        repeat layering 2 more times with remaining ingredients, 
        ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese.
        </p>
        <p>
        Step 7
        Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is lightly browned and bubbling, 
        about 30 minutes.</p>

    <h1>Cheeseburger Quesadilla</h1>

    <img src="cheeseburger.jpeg" alt="">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Burritoville, a local joint down by Southeast University here, specializes in some of the oddest burritos I've ever tasted. From the BBQ chicken to the Buffalo burrito, I've had them all, but they've got only one type of quesadilla. So I've decided to take one of my favorite burritos from there, the cheeseburger burrito and apply it to quesadilla form. Served with a side of fries and a Coke®, it's what I call my most recent of culinary triumphs.
         Serve with a side of ketchup, yellow mustard, and sweet relish.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <p>1 teaspoon butter <br>
            ½ small yellow onion, chopped <br>
            2 pounds ground beef <br>
            1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce <br>
            1 teaspoon salt <br>
            1 teaspoon ground black pepper <br>
            ½ teaspoon garlic powder
            cooking spray <br>
            8 (8 inch) flour tortillas<br>
            2 cups shredded Colby cheese<br>
            4 teaspoons ketchup, or to taste<br>
            4 teaspoons yellow mustard, or to taste<br>
            4 teaspoons sweet relish, or to taste</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p> Step 1 
                Heat butter in a saucepan over medium heat; 
                cook and stir onion until slightly tender, about 5 minutes.
                Add ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, salt, black pepper,
                and garlic powder; cook and stir until beef is browned and
                 crumbly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, drain liquid from beef, 
                and let sit for 2 minutes.
                <br>
                Step 2
                Heat a griddle or flat pan over medium heat and spray with cooking spray.
                <br>
                Step 3
                Place 1 tortilla on the hot griddle, top with some of the Colby cheese,
                 1/4 of the beef mixture, 1 teaspoon ketchup, 1 teaspoon mustard, 
                 and 1 teaspoon relish. Top with more Colby cheese and 1 tortilla. 
                 Flatten the quesadilla with your hand.
                <br>
                Step 4
                Flip quesadilla with a spatula and cook until browned and cheese is melted,
                 3 to 5 minutes more. Cut quesadilla into 4 pieces. 
                 Repeat with remaining tortillas, ground beef, cheese, ketchup, mustard,
                  and relish.</p>

                <h1>Mojo Roast chicken</h1>
                <img src="mojo.jpeg" alt="">

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Mojo-marinated roast chicken, just like grandma used to make!
                     Serve with white rice, which is the traditional way.
                      It's also great with mashed potatoes or in sandwiches with 
                      Cuban bread or fresh rolls. You can use half the mojo recipe for a 
                      smaller bird, drumsticks, or thighs.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <p>½ cup extra-virgin olive oil <br>
                    1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin <br>
                    1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt <br>
                    ½ teaspoon dried oregano <br>
                    2 tablespoons minced garlic <br>
                    3 tablespoons lime juice <br>
                    3 tablespoons orange juice <br>
                    1 (6 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <p>Step 1
                    Heat the olive oil in a small saucepan over medium-high heat until very hot.
                     While the oil heats, mash the cumin, salt, oregano, and garlic together 
                     into a paste in a heat-proof bowl; whisk the hot oil into the paste. 
                     Allow the mixture to cool slightly. Add the lime juice and orange juice; stir. 
                     Place the chicken in a large sealable bag; pour the marinade over the chicken and 
                     shake to assure an even coating. Refrigerate at least 4 hours, up to overnight.
                     <br>
                    
                    Step 2
                    Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                     Arrange the marinated chicken in a roasting pan.
                     <br>
                    Step 3
                    Bake the chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink at 
                    the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part
                     of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). <br>
